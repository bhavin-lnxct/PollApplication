              affiliated with a PRO, then you must notify your PRO of the
              royalty-free license you grant through these Terms in your User
              Content to us. You are solely responsible for ensuring your
              compliance with the relevant PRO’s reporting obligations. If you
              have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then you must
              obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant the
              royalty-free license(s) set forth in these Terms in your User
              Content or have such music publisher enter into these Terms with
              us. Just because you authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song)
              does not mean you have the right to grant us the license in these
              Terms. If you are a recording artist under contract with a record
              label, then you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use
              of the Services is in compliance with any contractual obligations
              you may have to your record label, including if you create any new

            </Text>
            <Text style={termsOfUseStyle.termsOfUseTextContainer}>
              THIS ARTICLE 18 GOVERNS HOW DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES ARE
              RESOLVED, AND REQUIRES THAT DISPUTES BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING
              INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY AS IT LIMITS
              CERTAIN RIGHTS INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE
              RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS OR
              OTHER COLLECTIVE ACTIONS.
              {'\n\n'}
              18.1. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification. In the
              event a dispute arises out of or relates to this Agreement, the
              Parties, in good faith, agree to first attempt to resolve the
              dispute between them through informal direct discussions prior to
              the initiation of arbitration. If, after a good faith effort to
              negotiate, one Party feels the dispute has not and cannot be
              resolved informally, the Party intending to pursue arbitration
              agrees to notify the other Party via email prior to initiating the
              arbitration.
              {'\n\n'}
              18.2. Agreement to Arbitrate. In the event the Parties cannot
              resolve a dispute through direct informal discussions, the Parties
              mutually agree that any dispute, claim, counterclaim, or
              controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement—including
              the applicability, breach, termination, validity, enforcement or
              interpretation thereof—or the use of the Site and/or Services
              (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding individual
              arbitration (the “Arbitration Agreement”). If there is a dispute
              about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or
              applies to a Dispute, the Parties mutually agree that the
              arbitrator will decide this issue.
              {'\n\n'}
              18.3. Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement. The Parties mutually
              agree that the following claims are exceptions to the Arbitration
              Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court
              of competent jurisdiction:
              {'\n\n'}
              (a) any claim related to actual or threatened infringement,
              misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks,
              trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; and
              {'\n\n'}
              (b) any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent
              circumstances. Filing of claims under this Section 18.3 shall not
              be deemed a waiver of either Party’s right under the Arbitration
              Agreement to have all other Disputes determined by individual
              arbitration in accordance with the terms of the Arbitration
              Agreement.
              {'\n\n'}
              18.4. Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. This Arbitration
              Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. The
              arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration
              Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the AAA Commercial
              Arbitration Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to
              be applicable by AAA (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as
              modified here. The arbitration will be heard and determined by a
              single arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision in any such
              arbitration will be final and binding upon the Parties and may be
              enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties agree
              that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the
              existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including,
              without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents
              submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions
              and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration
              proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial
              proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable
              disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory
              authorities or other governmental agencies. The Parties shall pay
              their own costs related to the arbitration, provided that in the
              final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs and fees of
              arbitration among the Parties in such amounts as the arbitrator
              deems appropriate.
              {'\n\n'}
              18.5. Jury Trial Waiver. Both User and Ponder acknowledge and
              agree that they are waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all
              disputes subject to arbitration.
              {'\n\n'}
              18.6. No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings. Both User
              and Ponder acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent
              permitted by law, each is waiving the right to participate as a
              plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit,
              class-wide arbitration, collective action, private attorney
              general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all
              Disputes. Disputes may not be arbitrated on a class, collective or
              representative basis. Unless User and Ponder both otherwise
              agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the
              claims of other persons or parties, or otherwise preside over any
              form of class action or representative proceeding. If the “class
              action lawsuit” waiver or the “class-wide arbitration” waiver in
              this Section is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute,
              then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed void
              with respect to such Dispute and the Dispute must proceed in
              court. If the “collective action” waiver or the “private attorney
              general action” waiver or the “representative proceeding” waiver
              in this Section 17.6 is held unenforceable with respect to any
              Dispute, those waivers may be severed from this Arbitration
              Agreement and the Parties agree that any private attorney general
              claims and representative claims in the Dispute will be severed
              and stayed, pending the resolution of any claims subject to
              arbitration in the Dispute in individual arbitration.
              {'\n\n'}
              18.7. Severability, No Waiver. Except as provided in Section 18.6,
              if any provision of the Arbitration Agreement is found to be
              invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of
              no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of the
              Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
              {'\n\n'}
              18.8. Survival Past Termination. Unless superseded by a later
              arbitration agreement between the Parties, this Arbitration
              Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement.
              {'\n\n'}
              18.9. Jurisdiction/venue. The parties further agree to the
              exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts in Los
              Angeles County, California, as the case may be, for purposes of
              any pre-arbitral injunctive relief, including any application for
              a preliminary injunction or order compelling arbitration, and
              waive any objection to laying venue in any such action or
              proceeding in such courts, or that such courts are an inconvenient
              forum or do not have jurisdiction over such party. Neither the
              parties nor the arbitrators may publicly disclose the existence,
              content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior
              written consent of both parties.

            <Text style={termsOfUseStyle.termsOfUseTextContainer}>
              21.1. These terms constitute the entire agreement between Users
              and Ponder regarding use of the Services, although additional
              terms may apply to licensed cannabis businesses.
              {'\n\n'}
              21.2. The failure of Ponder to enforce any right or provision
              of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement
              of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or
              provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a
              duly authorized representative of Ponder. Except as expressly
              set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of
              its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its
              other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason a
              court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms
              invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the
              maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms
              will remain in full force and effect.

              21.3. Should any competent court or arbitrator determine that any
              provision of these Terms is unenforceable as written, then said
              provision shall be deemed to have been rewritten in accordance
              with the law; if that is not possible, then that provision shall
              be deemed to have been stricken from the Terms, and all other
              provisions remain in full force and effect. If you do not agree to
              these Terms, please stop using Service immediately.
              {'\n\n'}
              21.4. These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights
