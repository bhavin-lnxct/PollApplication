              affiliated with a PRO, then you must notify your PRO of the
              royalty-free license you grant through these Terms in your User
              Content to us. You are solely responsible for ensuring your
              compliance with the relevant PRO’s reporting obligations. If you
              have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then you must
              obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant the
              royalty-free license(s) set forth in these Terms in your User
              Content or have such music publisher enter into these Terms with
              us. Just because you authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song)
              does not mean you have the right to grant us the license in these
              Terms. If you are a recording artist under contract with a record
              label, then you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use
              of the Services is in compliance with any contractual obligations
              you may have to your record label, including if you create any new
